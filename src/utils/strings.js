Apple cannot validate the privacy and security of your information, cannot verify transactions and cannot help with related customer issues.\n
App Store payment features are not available for purchases made on an external website. Your securely stored payment method on file will not be used. These purchases will not appear in your App Store purchase history, subscriptions cannot be managed through the App Store and will not be available. Report a problem cannot be used for refund requests, which will be handled by the developer.\n
If you are not comfortable making an account or purchase on an external website, you can contact the developer and request support for App Store payments, or find apps that do support app store payments. If you have concerns about the safety or security of your information, you can report fraud or scams using report a Problem on the App Store.`,
